Example Wiki
============

Place the content of your *slim wiki* into this directory. Write it using
[GitHub flavored](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown) [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).

Use the main page as overview and add links to subpages:

- [Cheat Sheets](cheat_sheets) - You can add links to directories having a `index.md`.
- [Markdown cheat sheet](cheat_sheets/Markdown_cheat_sheet) - Or add direct a link to a markdown file.

**Notes:**

- The extension `.md` is optional when linking to markdown files.
- Underscores in directory or file names are shown as spaces in the breadcrumbs. So if you name your file `My_new_page.md`, it will be shown as `My new page`.

Alternative Header 1
====================


Alternative Header 2
--------------------

A simple Link: http://google.de

This is a paragraph, which is text surrounded by whitespace. Paragraphs can be on one
line (or many), and can drone on for hours.

Here is a Markdown link to [a named link](http://google.de).

Now some inline markup like _italics_,  **bold**, ~~strike through~~ and `code()`. Note that underscores_in_words are ignored in [GitHub flavored](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown) Markdown.

> Blockquotes are like quoted text in email replies
>> And, they can be nested

Bullet lists:

* Bullet lists are easy too
- Another one
+ Another one

Numbered lists:

1. A numbered list
2. Which is numbered
3. With periods and a space

And now some code:

    // Code is just text indented a bit
    which(is_easy) to_remember();

~~~
// Un-indented code blocks work too

if (this_is_more_code == true && !indented) {
    // tild wrapped code blocks, also not indented
}
~~~

Text with  
two trailing spaces  
(on the right)  
can be used  
for things like poems  

### Horizontal rules

--------------------------

<div style="font-size: 20px; color:green; text-shadow: 4px 4px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);">
This is <b>embedded HTML</b>
</div>

## Tables ##

| Header | Header | Right  |
| ------ | ------ | -----: |
|  Cell  |  Cell  |   $10  |
|  Cell  |  Cell  |   $20  |

* Outer pipes on tables are optional
* Colon used for alignment (right versus left)
